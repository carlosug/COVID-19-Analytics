The current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019.

Since mid-february, [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) reports the number of diagnoses with the coronavirus and their residence on a daily base. The data contains the total number of positively tested (confirmed), deaths and recovery patients. ~The [raw dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) can be found on the github repository. This dataset is daily updated.

## This is a developing story :exclamation: Daily updates :exclamation:

## Tips for improvements

Suggest on this project is appreciated. I am looking for new features for the data pipelines.

See [data science pipeline](src/script.R) for technical details regarding data collection and cleaning.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Graphs globally

The following graphs show the development of Coronavirus on a daily basis. The [outputs](/outputs) are updated on an hourly basis and were generated automatically. Please validate the numbers in the graphs before publishing. See the license section for information about sharing the graphs.

### Regression

The first predictions are based on exponential growth model.

Note, however that the data no longer behave exponentially. If we plot them on
a log axis they deviate from the line quite drastically!
